This folder contains a program that allows a user to perform the four basic math operations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide). 

For each step, you will create a new branch. When you're done, please send us the zipped repository.

You will perform: 
0. Create a repository and add the initial version to the master branch.
1. Code review this codebase.
2. Write new test cases.
3. Sketch the new requirements.

CODE REVIEW:
1. Create a new branch 'code-review'.
2. Add your code review comments between C# comments //CODE_REVIEW
3. Commit those comments to the repository.

TEST CASES:
1. Create a new branch 'test-cases'.
2. Check the CalculatorTest project and add new test cases if you consider there's not covered code.
3. The code coverage in the solution is too low (close to 30%). What will you do to increase the code coverage?.
3. Commit the code to the repository.

NEW REQUIREMENTS:
There are 2 new requirements:
  - Allow the user to define the color of the results.
  - Allow the user to pick a different language for the messages.

1. Create a new branch 'sprint-2'.
2. Write the interfaces you would add. (No need to implement them).
3. Write the changes needed to support those new interfaces.
4. Commit the code to the repository.
